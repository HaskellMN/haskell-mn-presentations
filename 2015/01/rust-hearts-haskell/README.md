# Rust â™¥'s Haskell

This is a presentation about [Rust](http://www.rust-lang.org/) given by [Andrew Clarkson](https://github.com/bitborn) to the [HaskellMN](http://www.meetup.com/HaskellMN/) group at the [January 2015 Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/HaskellMN/events/218800623/). If you liked this, you'll love the great Haskell slingers at this Meetup.

This talk highlights some of the more functional aspects of Rust that were explicitly stolen from Haskell and similarly minded functional languages (ML and OCaml).

The presentation can be [viewed live here](http://bitborn.github.io/rust-hearts-haskell/slides.html).

#Disclaimer

This talk was given by a amature Rusticorn (Rustacean?, Rusticator?) and no doubt contains amature explanations and possibly errors, luckily you can [lodge issues](https://github.com/bitborn/rust-hearts-haskell/issues) and submit pull requests to fix my mistakes!

Though it is likely fairly obvious this presentation does not reflect the opinions of HaskellMN, The Rust Project, or Mozilla. :)
